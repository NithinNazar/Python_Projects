# Review:
# Create a function called greet().
# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.

# Simple function
# def greet():
#     print("hello Nithin")
#     print("how do you do Morpheus?")
#     print("isn't the weather nice today?")

# greet()

# Function that allows for input

# def greet_with_name(name):
#     print(f"hello {name}")
#     print(f"how do you do {name}?")
#
# greet_with_name("Trinity")

#Function with more than one input

# def greet_with(name, location):
#     print(f'hello {name}')
#     print(f"isn't the weather nice in {location}?")
#     print(f"What is it like in {location}?")
#
# greet_with("Paul Barber", "Utopia")

#Functions with keyword arguments
# def greet_with(name, location):
#     print(f'hello {name}')
#     print(f"isn't the weather nice in {location}?")
#     print(f"What is it like in {location}?")
#
# greet_with(location = "Utopia", name="Paul Barber")
